# zshrc-configuration

My personal .zshrc configuration

## What is this

In this repo, you can find a .zshrc example, containing the aliases and function I configure on my own and use everyday.
Most of them are GIT commands aliases, including aliases for Conventional Commits, but not only.

## How to use it

If you want to use my .zshrc, feel free to do it; you have a couple of ways to do it, for example:

1. Clone this repository in your ~ folder, then add the following line to your .zshrc: `source ~/zshrc-configuration/.zshrc`
2. Just copy paste the aliases from this repo in your .zshrc
