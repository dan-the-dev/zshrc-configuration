# zshrc-configuration

My personal .zshrc configuration

## What is this

In this repo, you can find a .zshrc example, containing the aliases and function I configure on my own and use everyday.
Most of them are GIT commands aliases, including aliases for Conventional Commits, but not only.

## How to use it

### Use Boostrap Script

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `boostrap.config.example` in `bootstrap.config` (command: `cp bootstrap.config.example bootstrap.config`) and configure your MAC APP STORE account in its variables
3. Run `bootstrap.sh` bash script

#### Coming next

- Chance to config the tools to be installed

### Simply use .zshrc file config

If you want to use my .zshrc, feel free to do it; you have a couple of ways to do it, for example:

1. Clone this repository in your ~ folder, then add the following line to your .zshrc: `source ~/zshrc-configuration/.zshrc`
2. Just copy paste the aliases or anything else you like from this repo in your .zshrc
